## Details

If necessary, describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail.

## Link to zsh-aliases logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your _full_ zsh-aliases logs, and link them here.
Do _NOT_ paste your full zsh-aliases logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read!
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include zsh-aliases logs!
